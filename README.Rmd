# My first repository

Welcome to my GitHub repo! :smile:

Here I will *commit*, _pull_ and *push* plaintext documents and `code`.    

Here is a cute picture from [this source](https://pixabay.com/en/chicks-feather-chicken-plumage-349035/).

## A new section

I just wrote *this* in RStudio!

## Another new section created on GitHub

I will need to **pull** this!    

## Evaluated R code

The `chickwts` dataset in R has `r nrow(chickwts)` rows.

```{r chickplot}
plot(chickwts$weight ~ chickwts$feed,
     xlab = 'Feed type',
     ylab = 'Weight (grams)',
     col = 2:7)
```
